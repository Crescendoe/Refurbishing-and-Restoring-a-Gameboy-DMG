            <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
            <p>It is a good idea to read through this manual and diagnose the Gameboy and its problems before starting the actual repairs. By prepping this way, the time spent on this project can be cut down quite a bit. By knowing what needs to be bought and what needs to be done it is possible to gauge the time and money spent for the specific Gameboy. The time and money spent is a nice proportion. If you have the time, it is smarter to buy the cheaper supplies that are the same quality, but they will take longer to deliver from most places. If you're pressed for time, spending a little more money to get the parts and supplies you need would be the way to go. The more money you spend, the quicker this will be. The cheaper you go, the longer it will take. If you go big, the whole process can take about a week. If you pinch pennies, the process is likely to take up to a month if it’s your first time. Besides waiting on supplies, only cleaning the Gameboy will only take about an hour. If all repairs need to be done, it can last about an hour and a half to two hours. If retro-brighting is needed, it will add about three to four more hours. The amount of work put into the project is entirely up to you.</p>
            <p>With this manual, I hope to teach how to use basic skills to take apart, clean, and fix a Gameboy handheld system. This process is something that can be applied to other simple electronics so that they can be fixed instead of just replaced. Refurbishing Gameboy systems is also a very widespread hobby with a growing community. This has been a hobby of mine for three years now and I am excited to share. The manual will show anyone interested from collectors, to people looking to save money, how to refurbish a Gameboy</p>

            <h1>Video Resources</h1>
            <p>There are many resources online that can help with refurbishing a Gameboy. Here are a few examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Retro Future on YouTube has a great detailed tutorial, one of the first videos I watched when getting into electronic repair: <a href="https://youtu.be/q_8PPujb-xI?si=30G11JY2_2Hf6XAg" target="blank">Link</a></li>
                <li>Odd Tinkering on youtube is also really good, their videos are more of an ASMR approach so you really have to pay attention. However they go in depth about retr0-brighting and have a great set-up for it: <a href="https://youtu.be/lW9uKZE4yJ0?si=8oTUQ2N0MGyZi6e3" target="blank">Link</a></li>
                <li>Places like; ebay, aliexpress, amazon, etsy, and ifixit are great resources to buy any of the parts you may need for this repair. There are even custom shells, better screens, and modifications that can be bought for the Gameboy</li>

            <h1>Materials</h1>
            <p>When refurbishing a gameboy, there isn’t a lot of supplies you need to do the basics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A screwdriver set (the Gameboy has tri-wing screws and phillips screws. A flathead can also come in handy. I recommend using a Y0 for the tri-wing, a PH00-1 will work for the phillips)</li>
                <li>Isopropyl alcohol (alcohol will dry up much quicker than water and won't cause any damage when cleaning parts)</li>
                <li>Soft bristled toothbrush and Q-tips</li>
                <li>Gloves (these are pretty nice depending on how dirty the Gameboy is)</li>
                <li>Tweezers (not required but makes things easier)</li>
                <li>Soap</li>
                <li>4 AA batteries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A soldering iron might be required depending on the Gameboys condition. If the screens have lines running up and down, the connections will need to be reconnected using soldering. If the speaker is busted, a replacement will also have to be soldered on. Soldering is a process where a hot instrument applies heat to a metal with a low melting point in order to make connections on electrical equipment. The soldering iron comes to a point at the tip in order to make it more precise. The use of heat from a heat gun, hair dryer, or microwave might also be needed.</p>
            <p>Retro-brighting might also be necessary depending on how yellow the plastic shell of the Gameboy is. Retro-brighitng is a technique coined by the refurbishing community that means bleaching yellowed plastic to renew its original color. It can be used on shoes, plastics and much more. A UV light or the sun will work great to bleach the material. Most people will use hydrogen peroxide as a sort of catalyst to make the process take a few hours instead of days. In this case the Gameboy shell would be submerged in hydrogen peroxide with a UV light shining over it for about 3-5 hours in order to restore it.</p>
